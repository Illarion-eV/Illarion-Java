halfling.description=Malicious tongues say that three things are most important for Halflings. That would be breakfast, lunch and dinner\! To the ignorant, Halflings look like the children of humans. The most significant difference to humans besides their small height are their big and hairy feet. They also tend towards a longer lifespan.
