Use it this way:

Select the item on the right-hand side and then press the '+' to add the data or the flag to add an annotation.
<br/>
For the item data, a little window opens where you can add the 'key' and the 'value'.
<br/>
Using a book as an example, the key could be &quot;nameEN&quot; and the value would be &quot;Book of the secret
map techniques&quot;.
<br/>
Please keep in mind that you need a key and a value in both languages.
<br/>
For the annotations, a little window opens where you can add your text.
<br/>
Annotations are used for tiles/items which shouldn't be deleted, e.g. city depots which have data or quest
items.

<br/>
To add a warp point you have to select a target X, Y and Z (target layer) position.
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
Your warp point starts at 0, 0, 0 and 0, 0, 1 should warp you to the next level.
<br/>
You type your target coordinates (0, 0, 1) in the target X, Y and Z (target layer) fields and then you select
the field where it should start (0, 0, 0).
<br/><br/>
Your current, opened maps are shown on the left-hand side of your map editor. You can close them if you select
the &quot;X&quot; button or hide it by removing the tick.
