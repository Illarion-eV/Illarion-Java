Your warp point starts at 0, 0, 0 and 0, 0, 1 should warp you to the next level.
<br />
You type your target coordinates (0, 0, 1) in the target X, Y and Z (target layer) fields and then you select
the field where it should start (0, 0, 0).
<br /><br />
Your current, opened maps are shown on the left-hand side of your map editor. You can close them if you select
the &quot;X&quot; button or hide it by removing the tick.
