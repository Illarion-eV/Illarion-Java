title=Select update channels
descriptionGeneral=The selected update channel selects the quality and the up-to-dateness of the application. You can \
  switch the channels as you like. If a channel is not working as you want it to, you can switch back to the old one \
  without problems. There are currently two channels we are using.
descriptionRelease=The release channel contains the last released version of the application. These versions are \
  announced by the news. This channel is the best choice for players of the game.
descriptionSnapshot=The development channel contains the current state of the development. Its possible that these \
  versions are not always working. The development channel is the best choice for developers and for the utility \
  applications, as those applications are likely to receive important updates as the development progresses.
